# Car Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for training a car price prediction model. The price of a car depends on various factors, such as the brand's goodwill, car features, horsepower, mileage, and more. Car price prediction is a significant research area in machine learning, and this project aims to provide a learning resource to train a car price prediction model.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of car information, including features like brand, horsepower, mileage, and price. This dataset will be used for training and evaluating the machine learning model.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the car data to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical features. This step aims to transform the car data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.

3. **Feature Selection/Engineering**: Select relevant features or engineer new features that might have a significant impact on the car price. This step helps improve the model's performance by focusing on the most informative features.

4. **Model Training**: Use machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests, to train a model on the labeled car dataset. The model will learn patterns and relationships between the car features and their corresponding prices.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared score. This step helps assess how well the model predicts car prices based on the given features.

6. **Prediction**: Utilize the trained model to predict the price of new, unseen cars. This allows the car price prediction model to be used for practical purposes, such as estimating the value of used cars or assisting in pricing decisions.

## Repository Files

The repository includes the following files:

1. `car price prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the car price prediction model. This notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations of the data preprocessing, feature selection/engineering, model training, model evaluation, and car price prediction.

2. `car data.csv`: CSV file containing the car dataset used for training and evaluating the price prediction model. The file includes car information, such as brand, horsepower, mileage, and price.

## How to Use

To use this project and train a car price prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/getrudetrudy01/car-price-prediction.git
   ```

2. Open the `car price prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and train the car price prediction model.

4. If you want to use the trained model for prediction on new car data, make sure to have the necessary input data in a similar format as the `car data.csv` file. You can load the trained model from the notebook and apply it to the new car data to predict their prices.

## Conclusion

The car price prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to estimate car prices based on various features. By training a model on a labeled car dataset, the project aims to develop a car price prediction model that can provide valuable insights into the pricing factors of cars. The Jupyter Notebook provided allows for an interactive and flexible environment to explore, develop, and enhance the car price prediction process.
